# Explanation
Repository to aggregate all my java studies.  
The main reason to store it here is:  

- Create some scripts to train some concepts;
- Create solutions to have code base to future consultation;
- See my progress;  

### Files Content
- ListIteration.java
    - Create a list of ids
    - Create a HashMap using the ID's
    - Use HashMap methods
    - Create scenarios to iterate over lists
    - Print the result
- HasDuplicatedChars
    - Create a function that identifies if a given word has duplicated chars
    - If the word is "abc" the function will return false
    - If the word is "aba" the function will return true

Fell free to create new scripts and open PR's to merge to my repo.
